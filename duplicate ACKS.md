duplicate ACKs occur when the receiver receives the same packet multiple times. it can happen because:

1. **Packet Lost and Retransmitted**: Let's say the sender sends a packet to the receiver, but the packet gets lost in transit (maybe due to network congestion or errors). The sender, not receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) for that packet, assumes it's lost and retransmits it.

2. **Original Packet Arrives Late**: Sometimes, the original packet that was thought to be lost might actually be delayed and eventually reach the receiver after the sender has already retransmitted it. So, now the receiver has received the same packet twice.

3. **Network Reordering**: Network conditions can cause packets to arrive at the receiver in a different order than they were sent. If the ACK for a particular packet is delayed or lost, the sender may retransmit that packet, causing the receiver to receive it again.

Duplicate ACKs are essentially acknowledgments from the receiver for the same packet number. These duplicate ACKs are a way for the receiver to inform the sender that it has received the same packet more than once.

In networking, duplicate ACKs are often used as a signal to the sender that it doesn't need to retransmit the same data again. Instead, the sender can focus on retransmitting the data that hasn't been acknowledged or take other appropriate actions to handle network issues.
