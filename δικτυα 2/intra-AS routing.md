interior gateway protocols (on the inside of gate)
- **RIP routing information protocol**
	- distance vector algorithm 
	- DVs (“information on costs”) exchanged every 30s
	- uses [[poisoned reverse]] to prevent loops

- **OSPF open shortest path first**
	- link state algorithm
	- advertisement - 1 entry per neighbor
	- advertisements to ENTIRE AS

- **IGRP interior gateway routing protocol**
