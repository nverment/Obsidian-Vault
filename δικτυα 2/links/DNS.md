domain name system

- uses [[UDP]] and [[TCP]]
- operates on port 53
- responsible for translating domain names to IP addresses 
- has “tree-like structure” where highest level is the root domain, then top-level domains, second-level domains and subnets
- utilizes **caching** (if we visit site often or recently save it in cache)
- operates in [[app layer]]

**name resolution process**
