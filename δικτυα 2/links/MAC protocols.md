- **channel partitioning** divide channel, allocate piece of node for exclusive use
	- **TDMA time division multiple access**
		- access to channel in “rounds”
	- **FDMA frequency division multiple access**
		- divide channel into multiple frequency bands, transmit in this frequency
		
- **random access** not divided, allow collisions, recover from them
- **“taking turns”** nodes get tokens, taking turns
