- equal sized packets
- time is slotted (divided)
- nodes are synced

- transmit only if no collision for one slot, else collision
- **efficiency** is the long-run fraction of successful slots when there are many nodes, each with many frames to send

prob that one node has success in slot **p(1-p)^(N-1)** 
prob that any node has success **Np(1-p)^(N-1)** 
*37% efficiency max*
